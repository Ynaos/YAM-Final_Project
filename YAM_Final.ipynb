        "- This Google Colab code installs several important Python libraries used for natural language processing, machine learning, and model optimization. The first line installs or upgrades Hugging Face tools such as transformers for working with pretrained NLP models, datasets for efficient data handling, and accelerate for speeding up model training across different hardware. It also adds Ray Tune and Optuna, two powerful frameworks for hyperparameter tuning. The second line installs TensorFlow for deep learning, openpyxl for working with Excel files, and scikit-learn for traditional machine learning methods, along with transformers again to ensure compatibility. Finally, the last line installs VADER Sentiment, a lightweight sentiment analysis tool commonly used for short texts like social media posts. Together, these libraries enable you to build, train, evaluate, and optimize NLP models within your Colab environment."

Finally, scikit-learn metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, classification reports, and confusion matrices are imported to evaluate model performance."

        "\n",
        "This part of the code handles uploading your dataset, preparing it for training, and converting it into a format compatible with Hugging Face models. First, it imports the Google Colab file uploader and waits for you to upload a CSV file — in this case, data_mmda_traffic_spatial.csv. Once uploaded, the file is read into a pandas DataFrame and its size is printed. The code assumes your text column is named \"Tweet\", then removes any rows where this text is missing. It also checks if the dataset already contains a sentiment label column (e.g., label, sentiment, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "If no label column exists, the code automatically generates sentiment labels using VADER, a rule-based sentiment analyzer. It assigns each tweet a compound sentiment score and converts it into a numeric label:\n",
        "\n",
        "- 0 = Negative\n",
        "\n",
        "- 1 = Neutral\n",
        "\n",
        "- 2 = Positive\n",
        "\n",
        "These become training labels called label_id. If a label column does exist, the code instead encodes it numerically using LabelEncoder.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the dataset is split into training (85%) and validation (15%) sets, with balanced sentiment distribution using stratification. Finally, both splits are converted into Hugging Face Dataset objects, renamed to use \"text\" and \"label\" columns, and stored in a DatasetDict. This prepares your uploaded dataset — data_mmda_traffic_spatial.csv — for model fine-tuning in the next steps.-"

        "This section of the code initializes the tokenizer and prepares your text data so it can be fed into a transformer model. It starts by selecting a pretrained model — in this case, distilbert-base-uncased, a lightweight and efficient version of BERT. Using this model name, it loads the corresponding AutoTokenizer, which is responsible for converting raw text into token IDs that the model can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, it defines a function called tokenize_fn(), which takes a batch of text and tokenizes it. **The tokenizer applies:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- truncation — cutting text that’s too long\n",
        "\n",
        "- padding — adding extra tokens so all sequences have equal length\n",
        "\n",
        "- max_length=128 — sets the maximum token size per input\n",
        "\n",
        "The code then applies this tokenizer function to the entire Hugging Face dataset using .map(), which efficiently processes it in batches. After tokenization, the original \"text\" column is removed since the model only needs tokenized input. The resulting dataset is put into PyTorch format, preparing it for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, it calculates how many different sentiment classes (labels) are present by checking the unique values in the label_id column. This allows the model to dynamically adapt whether your dataset has 2, 3, or more sentiment types."
